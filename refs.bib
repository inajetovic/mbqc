We highlight ways in which it is useful to understand one-way computation beyond simple equivalence with the quantum circuit model. We briefly review current proposals of implementations and experimental progress and summarize some recent related theoretical developments. Although the chapter is primarily didactic in focus, we include a number of new methods and observations. These include: a simpler and more compact formulation of one-way quantum computation in the stabilizer formalism; A new way of implementing unitaries diagonal in the computational basis; New results on the family of operations which may be implemented in a single round of measurements; A method for constructing compact one-way patterns by decomposing unitaries in terms of diagonal unitaries and Clifford group transformations.},

By combining the measurement calculus with an efficient graph state simulator, Graphix allows the classical preprocessing of Pauli measurements in the measurement patterns, significantly reducing the number of operations required to perform the quantum computation while maintaining determinism. For a measurement pattern translated from a quantum circuit, this corresponds to the preprocessing of all Clifford gates, and this improvement in the one-way model is important for efficient operations in quantum hardware with limited qubit numbers. In addition to the direct translation from gate networks, we provide a pattern generation method based on flow-finding algorithms, which automatically generates byproduct correction sequences to ensure determinism. We further implement optimization strategies for measurement patterns beyond the standardization procedure and provide tensor-network backend for classically simulating the MBQC.},

At the same time, they can be described by a number of parameters that grows only moderately with the system size. They have a variety of applications in quantum information theory, most prominently as algorithmic resources in the context of the one-way quantum computer, but also in other fields such as quantum error correction and multi-partite quantum communication, as well as in the study of foundational issues such as non-locality and decoherence. In this review, we give a tutorial introduction into the theory of graph states. We introduce various equivalent ways how to define graph states, and discuss the basic notions and properties of these states. The focus of this review is on their entanglement properties. These include aspects of non-locality, bi-partite and multi-partite entanglement and its classification in terms of the Schmidt measure, the distillability properties of mixed entangled states close to a pure graph state, as well as the robustness of their entanglement under decoherence. We review some of the known applications of graph states, as well as proposals for their experimental implementation.},

	abstract = {Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is a promising approach to reducing circuit depth in noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Unlike gate-based computing, MBQC employs local measurements on a preprepared resource state, offering a trade-off between circuit depth and qubit count. Ensuring determinism is crucial to MBQC, particularly in the VQE context, as a lack of flow in measurement patterns leads to evaluating the cost function at irrelevant locations. This study introduces MBVQE-ans{\textbackslash}"atze that respect determinism and resemble the widely used problem-agnostic hardware-efficient VQE ansatz. We evaluate our approach using ideal simulations on the Schwinger Hamiltonian and \$XY\$-model and perform experiments on IBM hardware with an adaptive measurement capability. In our use case, we find that ensuring determinism works better via postselection than by adaptive measurements at the expense of increased sampling cost. Additionally, we propose an efficient MBQC-inspired method to prepare the resource state, specifically the cluster state, on hardware with heavy-hex connectivity, requiring a single measurement round, and implement this scheme on quantum computers with \$27\$ and \$127\$ qubits. We observe notable improvements for larger cluster states, although direct gate-based implementation achieves higher fidelity for smaller instances.},

	abstract = {Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) offers a fundamentally unique paradigm to design quantum algorithms. Indeed, due to the inherent randomness of quantum measurements, the natural operations in MBQC are not deterministic and unitary, but are rather augmented with probabilistic byproducts. Yet, the main algorithmic use of MBQC so far has been to completely counteract this probabilistic nature in order to simulate unitary computations expressed in the circuit model. In this work, we propose designing MBQC algorithms that embrace this inherent randomness and treat the random byproducts in MBQC as a resource for computation. As a natural application where randomness can be beneficial, we consider generative modeling, a task in machine learning centered around generating complex probability distributions. To address this task, we propose a variational MBQC algorithm equipped with control parameters that allow to directly adjust the degree of randomness to be admitted in the computation. Our numerical findings indicate that this additional randomness can lead to significant gains in learning performance in certain generative modeling tasks. These results highlight the potential advantages in exploiting the inherent randomness of MBQC and motivate further research into MBQC-based algorithms.},

Methods to translate gate-based algorithms into the MBQC framework exist, but they are not always optimal in terms of resource cost. In our work, we propose an MBQC algorithm to run the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Furthermore, we apply the MBQC-QAOA algorithm to the MAX \$K\$-CUT problem, working for all values of \$K\$, expressing the cost Hamiltonian and its constraints in a form easily implementable in the MBQC model. We conclude analyzing the resource-cost of our algorithm, compared to the case of translating a gate-based QAOA algorithm into MBQC rules showing up to a 30-fold improvement. With our work, we contribute to close the gap between gate-based and MBQC near-term algorithms, a gap not reflecting the current status of the hardware development.},

	abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms are considered one of the most promising methods for obtaining near-term quantum advantages; however, most of these algorithms are only expressed in the conventional quantum circuit scheme. The roadblock to developing quantum algorithms with the measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) scheme is resource cost. Recently, we discovered that the realization of multi-qubit rotation operations requires a constant number of single-qubit measurements with the MBQC scheme, providing a potential advantage in terms of resource cost. The structure of the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA) aligns well with this characteristic. Thus, we propose an efficient measurement-based quantum algorithm for quantum many-body system simulation tasks, called measurement-based Hamiltonian variational ansatz (MBHVA). We then demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and advantages of the two-dimensional Heisenberg model and the Fermi-Hubbard chain. Numerical experiments show that MBHVA is expected to reduce resource overhead compared to quantum circuits, especially in the presence of large multi-qubit rotation operations. Furthermore, when compared to Measurement-based Hardware Efficient Ansatz (MBHEA), MBHVA also demonstrates superior performance. We conclude that the MBQC scheme is potentially feasible for achieving near-term quantum advantages in terms of both resource efficiency and error mitigation, particularly for photonic platforms.},

The client only needs to be able to prepare single qubits randomly chosen from a finite set and send them to the server, who has the balance of the required quantum computational resources. Our protocol is interactive: after the initial preparation of quantum states, the client and server use two-way classical communication which enables the client to drive the computation, giving single-qubit measurement instructions to the server, depending on previous measurement outcomes. Our protocol works for inputs and outputs that are either classical or quantum. We give an authentication protocol that allows the client to detect an interfering server; our scheme can also be made fault-tolerant. We also generalize our result to the setting of a purely classical client who communicates classically with two non-communicating entangled servers, in order to perform a blind quantum computation. By incorporating the authentication protocol, we show that any problem in BQP has an entangled two-prover interactive proof with a purely classical verifier. Our protocol is the first universal scheme which detects a cheating server, as well as the first protocol which does not require any quantum computation whatsoever on the client's side. The novelty of our approach is in using the unique features of measurement-based quantum computing which allows us to clearly distinguish between the quantum and classical aspects of a quantum computation.},

	abstract = {The application and analysis of the Cut-and-Choose technique in protocols secure against quantum adversaries is not a straightforward transposition of the classical case, among other reasons due to the difficulty to use rewinding in the quantum realm. We introduce a Quantum Computation Cut-and-Choose (QC-CC) technique which is a generalisation of the classical Cut-and-Choose in order to build quantum protocols secure against quantum covert adversaries. Such adversaries can deviate arbitrarily provided that their deviation is not detected. As an application of the QC-CC we give a protocol for securely performing two-party quantum computation with classical input/output. As basis we use secure delegated quantum computing (Broadbent et al 2009), and in particular the garbled quantum computation of (Kashefi et al 2016) that is secure against only a weak specious adversaries, defined in (Dupuis et al 2010). A unique property of these protocols is the separation between classical and quantum communications and the asymmetry between client and server, which enables us to sidestep the quantum rewinding issues. This opens the prospect of using the QC-CC to other quantum protocols with this separation. In our proof of security we adapt and use (at different parts) two quantum rewinding techniques, namely Watrous' oblivious q-rewinding (Watrous 2009) and Unruh's special q-rewinding (Unruh 2012). Our protocol achieves the same functionality as in previous works (e.g. Dupuis et al 2012), however using the QC-CC technique on the protocol from (Kashefi et al 2016) leads to the following key improvements: (i) only one-way offline quantum communication is necessary , (ii) only one party (server) needs to have involved quantum technological abilities, (iii) only minimal extra cryptographic primitives are required, namely one oblivious transfer for each input bit and quantum-safe commitments.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers are now on the brink of outperforming their classical counterparts. One way to demonstrate the advantage of quantum computation is through quantum random sampling performed on quantum computing devices. However, existing tools for verifying that a quantum device indeed performed the classically intractable sampling task are either impractical or not scalable to the quantum advantage regime. The verification problem thus remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we experimentally demonstrate efficiently verifiable quantum random sampling in the measurement-based model of quantum computation on a trapped-ion quantum processor. We create random cluster states, which are at the heart of measurement-based computing, up to a size of 4 x 4 qubits. Moreover, by exploiting the structure of these states, we are able to recycle qubits during the computation to sample from entangled cluster states that are larger than the qubit register. We then efficiently estimate the fidelity to verify the prepared states--in single instances and on average--and compare our results to cross-entropy benchmarking. Finally, we study the effect of experimental noise on the certificates. Our results and techniques provide a feasible path toward a verified demonstration of a quantum advantage.},

For delegated computation protocols to be usable in a larger context---or simply to securely run two protocols in parallel---the security definitions need to be composable. Here, we define composable security for delegated quantum computation. We distinguish between protocols which provide only blindness---the computation is hidden from the server---and those that are also verifiable---the client can check that it has received the correct result. We show that the composable security definition capturing both these notions can be reduced to a combination of several distinct "trace-distance-type" criteria---which are, individually, non-composable security definitions. Additionally, we study the security of some known delegated quantum computation protocols, including Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi's Universal Blind Quantum Computation protocol. Even though these protocols were originally proposed with insufficient security criteria, they turn out to still be secure given the stronger composable definitions.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of the variational quantum circuit synthesis into a gate set consisting of the CNOT gate and arbitrary single-qubit (1q) gates with the primary target being the minimization of the CNOT count. First we note that along with the discrete architecture search suffering from the combinatorial explosion of complexity, optimization over 1q gates can also be a crucial roadblock due to the omnipresence of local minimums (well known in the context of variational quantum algorithms but apparently underappreciated in the context of the variational compiling). Taking the issue seriously, we make an extensive search over the initial conditions an essential part of our approach. Another key idea we propose is to use parametrized two-qubit (2q) controlled phase gates, which can interpolate between the identity gate and the CNOT gate, and allow a continuous relaxation of the discrete architecture search, which can be executed jointly with the optimization over 1q gates. This coherent optimization of the architecture together with 1q gates appears to work surprisingly well in practice, sometimes even outperforming optimization over 1q gates alone (for fixed optimal architectures). As illustrative examples and applications we derive 8 CNOT and T depth 3 decomposition of the 3q Toffoli gate on the nearest-neighbor topology, rediscover known best decompositions of the 4q Toffoli gate on all 4q topologies including a 1 CNOT gate improvement on the star-shaped topology, and propose decomposition of the 5q Toffoli gate on the nearest-neighbor topology with 48 CNOT gates. We also benchmark the performance of our approach on a number of 5q quantum circuits from the ibm\_qx\_mapping database showing that it is highly competitive with the existing software.

In recent years, various methods for VQE structure optimization have been introduced but the capacities of machine learning to aid with this problem has not yet been fully investigated. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously explores the space of possible ans\{{\textbackslash}"a\}tze, identifying economic circuits which still yield accurate ground energy estimates. The algorithm is intrinsically motivated, and it incrementally improves the accuracy of the result while minimizing the circuit depth.

It is nonadaptive and therefore experimentally amenable. Under a plausible conjecture, classical sampling upto additive errors from this model is known to be hard. We present a trap-based verification scheme for quantum supremacy that only requires the verifier to prepare single-qubit states. The verification is done on the same model as the original sampler, a square lattice, with only a constant overhead. We next revamp our verification scheme in two distinct ways using fault tolerance that preserves the nonadaptivity. The first has a lower overhead based on error correction with the same threshold as universal quantum computation. The second has a higher overhead but an improved threshold (1.97{\textbackslash}\%) based on error detection. We show that classically sampling upto additive errors is likely hard in both these schemes. Our results are applicable to other sampling problems such as the Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time (IQP) computation model. They should also assist near-term attempts at experimentally demonstrating quantum supremacy and guide long-term ones.},
